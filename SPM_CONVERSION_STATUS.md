# NSXCTest Swift Package Manager Conversion Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current status of converting the NSXCTest framework from Xcode project to Swift Package Manager (SPM).

## Completed Steps

✅ **Project Structure Analysis**
- Examined the original Xcode project structure and dependencies
- Identified all source files, headers, and external dependencies

✅ **Package.swift Creation**
- Created a comprehensive Package.swift file with proper target configuration
- Separated C/Objective-C code into `NSXCTestObjC` target
- Created main `NSXCTest` Swift target with dependencies

✅ **Source Organization**
- Organized source files according to SPM structure under `Sources/`
- Created separate directories for NSXCTest and NSXCTestObjC targets
- Set up proper public headers structure

✅ **Dependency Management**
- Converted Carthage dependencies to SPM dependencies:
  - Swifter (HTTP server)
  - SwiftyJSON (JSON handling)
  - Fuzi (XML parsing)
  - AEXML (XML parsing)
  - CocoaLumberjack (Logging)
  - Nimble (Testing framework)

✅ **Platform-Specific Code Handling**
- Made UIKit imports conditional to support non-iOS platforms
- Added proper conditional compilation for iOS-specific features
- Fixed NSPasteboard conflicts by removing problematic files

## Current Challenges

⚠️ **XCTest Framework Dependencies**
The majority of Swift files cannot find core XCTest types like:
- `XCUIElement`
- `XCUIApplication` 
- `XCTestCase`
- `XCElementSnapshot`
- `XCUIElementQuery`

This is because NSXCTest is designed as a testing framework extension that assumes it's running within an XCTest environment.

⚠️ **Framework Design Issue**
The original framework is tightly coupled to iOS UI testing and XCTest framework, making it challenging to use as a standalone library.

## Remaining Work

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Add XCTest Import**
   - Most Swift files need `import XCTest` statements
   - Some files may need conditional compilation for testing vs. library use

2. **iOS-Specific Code**
   - Many components assume iOS environment
   - Need to make more code conditional on `#if canImport(UIKit)`

3. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Some imports may create circular dependencies in SPM
   - May need to restructure some extensions

### Architectural Considerations

1. **Library vs Testing Framework**
   - Decide if this should be a pure library or remain a testing framework
   - Testing frameworks have different SPM requirements than libraries

2. **Platform Support**
   - Current code is heavily iOS-specific
   - Consider if cross-platform support is needed

## Current Package Structure

```
Sources/
├── NSXCTestObjC/           # C/Objective-C target
│   ├── include/            # Public headers
│   │   ├── NSXCTest.h
│   │   ├── Header.h
│   │   └── module.modulemap
│   ├── PrivateHeaders/     # Implementation headers and .m files
│   └── libxml2/           # XML parsing headers
└── NSXCTest/              # Swift target
    ├── Foundation Extensions/
    ├── XCTest Extensions/
    ├── Util/
    ├── SystemAlert/
    ├── Locators/
    └── PageObject/
```

## Next Steps

1. Add missing `import XCTest` statements to Swift files
2. Test compilation with proper XCTest imports
3. Consider making the package iOS-specific if cross-platform support isn't needed
4. Address any remaining circular dependencies

## Notes

- The original Cartfile has been preserved for reference
- Original Xcode project structure is maintained alongside SPM structure
- All external dependencies have been successfully converted to SPM format
